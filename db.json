The camera is ok (somewhat better than the 11 I upgraded from, but not hugely so). What I found:Camera isn't fantastic, it's a incremental upgrade. It's ok.Screen is utterly superb, bright and fantastic, especially if you're coming from an earlier phone (pre 13).Finish is lovely, metal around edge is more silver than gold, rear is subtle and not garish at all. It's beautiful.Phone is fast and feels premium.I love this phone, but not for the reasons I thought I would. It doesn't disappoint at all."

I love the cameras, I love taking photos with this iPhone, I feel like I’m a professional photographer. This phone really amazes me. I took a lot of amazing pics for my family, everyone loves the pics taken by this phone. Even the ones who was toi shy to take pics love to have pics taken with this phone now. Because they look the same as in real in the pics taken by this phone. This is my favourite phone so far. I wish I got the Max one though. My next iPhone will definitely be a Max. I have used it for over a month now, still so happy having it."

I find the new dynamic island to be quite innovative and it certainly has lots of potential. It's crazy how fluid everything is with iOS 16 and the promotion display.The cameras are huge. The camera quality is great, shooting raw at 48MP does take a lot of space ~80MB per picture but the detail is insane. They've greatly improved the photo quality in the dark. One thing that I really like about iPhones is how quick they can take and process pictures after you press the button. They've also improved the front cameras significantly compared to last year everything looks more crisp.Battery life is really good as well, I'm not so sure as of yet how much the always on display is affecting battery life so far but I've turned mine off.Overall I love this phone!"

I’m not going into a deep review of it all but suffice to say it really does live up to the hype for once, and that’s rare!The screen is stunningly clear and simply gorgeous to look at. The whole phone really makes the very most of the latest iOS 16.1 operating system but by the time you read this it will have been developed even further for sure. Using this phone is just a dream and if you’re in a 5G area, you will be blown away by its speed."

      "introduction": "The iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max are smartphones designed, developed, and marketed by Apple Inc. They are the sixteenth-generation flagship iPhones, succeeding the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max. The devices were unveiled alongside the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus during the Apple Event at Apple Park in Cupertino, California on September 7, 2022 and were made available on September 16, 2022. Pre-orders for the iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max began on September 9, 2022. The iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max are the first iPhones to have a new type of display cutout called 'Dynamic Island', replacing the notch design that has been in use since the iPhone X was introduced in 2017. Along with the iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Pro models add bidirectional satellite connectivity to contact emergency services when out of range of Wi-Fi and cellular networks. iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max models (as well as the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus) sold in the United States dropped support for physical SIM cards, making them the first iPhone models since the CDMA variant of the iPhone 4 to not come with a discrete SIM card reader.",

I no longer have to hang out of a window to get a signal on either SIM. The finger print reader is now on the main screen and for me this is an improvement over the S9. I was always smudging the camera! The interface is much improved and more intuitive. The new processor speed is very noticeable! Can't comment on battery life as only had it 24 hours. Also happy that the annoying Bixby button that was too close to the volume controls has now gone. I don't have the option of adding a memory card, but this has plenty for my needs internally. Overall very happy with the move."

The screen is excellent and the extra size compared to the S10e is actually quite welcome.The only weakness is the fingerprint reader, which is unreliable at best. Most of the time I have to touch and hold the screen for a couple of seconds to then get told my fingerprint is not recognized. Also be careful with 9H glass screen protectors, have tried 2 different brands and neither worked, why couldn't Samsung stick with a physical reader.Overall I am very pleased with the phone, I went for the 256gb model as there is no SD Card slot, but you can put two SIM cards in it. I took advantage of the trade in program and got £300 off the price with an additional discount."

The worst thing comes when you return it, and the seller You Get - Innovation & Technology doesn't want to return all the money because he says you opened the box and returns only part of it.

      "introduction": "Xiaomi has announced the Mi 10T Pro, its latest flagship phone. The device follows the strategy seen last year, where the sleek Mi 9 was followed by a largely unrelated Mi 9T Pro with a heavier emphasis on specs. The Mi 9T Pro was one of the best phone bargains of 2019 in markets where it was available, so expectations should be high for the 10T Pro.The two standout specs on the Mi 10T Pro are its screen and its battery. It uses a 6.67-inch 1080p 20:9 LCD with a refresh rate of 144Hz. That refresh rate is what you’d expect from a high-end gaming monitor, and until now it’s mostly only been found on gaming-focused smartphones, making this the most mainstream phone yet to achieve it. Because the screen uses an LCD panel, though, the fingerprint sensor is integrated into the power button rather than the display.",

The user guide, although it does cover all the most important points, is not presented in the best way. For example, it explains how to insert SIM and memory cards. In fact a memory card is not required unless you have very large memory requirements, e.g. a great many photos. The procedure for connecting to Wi-Fi and setting up e-mail would be better placed earlier. Still, if you go through the guide from cover to cover you will find most of what you need."

To date I've been buying Huawei phones but decided to try this Nokia G50 5G for a change.Not really interested in the camera though there's an impressive array on the back of the phone, it's quite heavy and rather large which I don't mind but someone with smaller hands might struggle with.Broadly the phone is no better or worse than any other in the price range I guess. One of the principal selling points of this phone is the size and performance of the battery which I'd not dispute however the quality and performance of the charger is very disappointing, I used the accompanying charger once and realized on the basis of how hot it got that it's barely appropriate not to mention the extended period to fully charge."

Comes preloaded with the usally bloatware (some you can remove - most you can't - still no 'track your phone' app included). Comes with a back cover but no front cover to protect the face. Finger/voice/face recognition unlock if you want (i still prefer the keypad). When a phone says it comes with 120gb, expect 20% of it filled with the firmware and preloaded apps. comes charged (60% by the time i switched it on). Fairly simple phone operation and simple to root if you want. Needs more option for sound and picture quality (phone was set to colour saturation, rather than natural). The only real issue is that all the buttons are on one side, the on/off/sleep button is next to the volume button (why it's not on the other side?) and a pointless 'google assist' button which could have been an standard app. Overall descent phone for the price and range (also a bit chunky. Update. phone screen feels slippy to the touch and the response to tapping an icon is sometimes lacking."

It offers excellent pictures in all light situations and offers greater versatility compared to the 8, although the 8 is in my opinion an excellent camera phone. I am still learning many of the available functions. To date very pleased and yes is expensive but you only live once."

          "text": "I decided to finally upgrade from the iPhone X to the iPhone 13 Pro Max (like many users it seems!), and I'll say straight off the bat its worth it. I seriously can't remember in recent memory there being better advancements in 1 year, with the only thing I dislike being that the connector is still lightning and not USB C.My iPhone X was a pain this past 12 months, with the battery in particular a constant source of frustration. It was showing 82% battery health, but I would be lucky to get more than a few hours. The 13 Pro Max literally lasts a whole day of use, and I still don't need to charge it. It has 8 hours (over 30%!) more video playback than the 12 Pro Max and 15 hours more than my iPhone X, ideal for those of us who watch a lot of videos on our phones. Can't forget the 50% more audio playback too!The 120hz screen really is a game changer for iPhones, and makes swiping such a smoother and more enjoyable experience - something really underrated considering how often we'll swipe over the course of a day. The 1,000 nits (1,200 nits with HDR content) compared to my iPhone X's 625 nits makes a huge difference when viewing the phone in sunlight."

To be finding my battery draining 15-20% in 10 hours overnight when I'm not using it felt like too much. I like to keep my phone battery charged above 50%, so if I ever needed to take it anywhere where I would be using it at least some of the time, I'd have to ensure I'd got a battery pack with me too."

I've actually managed 2 days of moderate usage (including camera, social media, and some light gaming) and STILL had 55% battery remaining. All this usage was while at home connected to wifi. This is head and shoulders above any other phone I've ever used. Most Android devices I've used would be at around 20% battery remaining with similar usage patterns. I feel confident that I could manage 4 or maybe even 5 days of non-usage before the device needed charging if I really needed to. I also feel confident that I don't need to keep the phone charged above 50% because that still gives me over a day of moderate usage. My long-term battery anxiety has vanished since getting this phone."

I was previously using a cheap Nokia 'dumb' phone for this and whilst it did an ok job, it wasn't always clear which text messages had been sent to which SIM, so I though a smart phone might be better - and it is. Well, this one is anyway. I can clearly see which text messages have been sent to which SIM and I've set it up to always ask me which SIM to use when making calls. Unfortunately, it doesn't appear possible to make it always ask which SIM to use when sending a text, but it's easy enough to change before replying to a message (it shows a number icon, 1 or 2, so you know which SIM is currently selected)."

The overall impression was that this was a luxury product at a budget price. Then there was the phone. I was expecting it to feel plasticity and cheap. What I found was a phone that was nicely weighty and felt extremely well built. The initial set up was easy but it did take a little time as it had to download two updates, each of over a gigabyte in size but once that was done everything was set up in a couple of minutes. The interface, which, again, I thought was going to be slow and sluggish, was smooth and responsive. The only negative is the resolution of the cameras and it could have more built-in memory (although you can use an SD card to expand the memory), apart from that this is a fantastic phone. I don't know if I'll even get an iPhone when the next version comes out, I actually really like this Nokia."

The problem was to buy it from a trusted location, my seller was “Celulandia” recommended, plus it was with FBA, which protects your purchase.From the cell phone I already have 1 month with it and I will try to solve possible doubts from buyers:* The battery lasts 1 and a half days of moderate to rough use.* Comes unlocked, with slot for 2 SIMS, I use telcel and grabbed it without problems."

I fancied a change, I'd been bogged down by how restrictive iOS is and couldnt wait to get my hands on an android device.The phone is great - Amazing build quality, the S Pen is suprisingly handy, and overall its a wonderful experience.Then, theres the battery. Which, if im honest about, was slightly dissapointing. Now, that being said, after owning the phone for a few days, it has started to improve after a few settings changed and the phone has had some time to learn my habbits. Fingers crossed it gets even better, from what ive seen on reddit it takes a few weeks to learn."

Especially with the one UI 5.0, butter runs soft. The camera is great and the display is simply amazing.There are hardly any points of criticism.I miss the jack connection because of good headphones that I own, but I bought an adapter on USBC and it works perfectly.And for over 1000€, a fast charging cable should be included, but that's another topic.jj"

Those that are not in the store can be downloaded as APK files from the browser. Still others are present such as QuickApp, such as the Post Office app. It doesn't lack anything, on the contrary, the absence of GMS means that the phone is super fast and the battery lasts longer.

Despite lacking a few of the flagship features found in the 14 pro,(such as a 120 hertz display, a few camera upgrades and the dynamic island) it still punches above its weight it terms of quality. After looking at the specifications of this phone and comparing it to the pro model, there are far more similarities than differences. The camera is still spectacular and apart from the macro lens, you would struggle to see the differences in pictures taken with both phones. To summarise, it’s a great phone that’s worth the money."

I've never had an iPhone so from my perspective this item is insanely good.The screen is large, battery lasts long and the camera is extremely good (it supersedes what I had on my previous phones). It's expensive but worth the money.However, from what I understood, the refresh frame on the screen on the Plus version is a bit lower than the Pro. So perhaps if you are picky when it comes to iphones, look into that because it might bother you. It doesnt bother me at all (due to my previous phone being total garbo)."

Ich bin äußerst zufrieden mit dem Wechsel, whatsapp, Zeitung, Email etc. sind jetzt (zur Not) auch ohne Lesebrille lesbar. Das Pro max war mir schlicht zu teuer, dessen sicher super Kamera wäre für meine Bedürfnisse überzogen, die Kamera des 'normalen' 14/14 plus ist schon super für mich. Ob 60 hz oder 120 hz Anzeige ist mir egal, ich bin kein Gamer. Alles in Allem ein tolles, großes Telefon mit dem man für die nächsten Jahre bedient sein wird. Ansonsten ist es natürlich unübertroffen wie Apple alles zu einen Ökosystem zusammengeführt hat, Iphone, Ipad, Iwatch und Apple TV harmonieren perfekt zusammen, ohne das übliche Geärgere wie bei Android üblich sobald es um mehr als ein Gerät geht."

      "introduction": "The iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus (also stylized as iPhone 14+) are smartphones designed, developed, and marketed by Apple Inc. They are the sixteenth generation of iPhones, succeeding the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini, and was announced during Apple Event, Apple Park in Cupertino, California on September 7, 2022, alongside the higher-priced iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max flagships. The iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus feature a 6.1-inch (15 cm) and 6.7-inch (17 cm) display, improvements to the rear-facing camera, and satellite connectivity for contacting emergency services when a user in trouble is beyond the range of Wi-Fi or cellular networks.The iPhone 14 was made available on September 16, 2022 and iPhone 14 Plus was made available on October 7, 2022 respectively, and was launched with iOS 16. Pre-orders for the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus began on September 9, 2022.The iPhone 14 does not have a 'Mini' version like the iPhone 13 Mini from last year. Instead, Apple has reintroduced a larger dimension iPhone 14 named the iPhone 14 Plus. Apple has not introduced a Plus model iPhone since the iPhone 8 Plus in 2017. iPhone 14 and 14 Plus models (as well as iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max models) sold in the United States drop support for physical SIM cards, making them the first iPhone models since the CDMA variant of the iPhone 4 to not come with a discrete SIM card reader.",

I have had it for six months now and I don't regret buying it nor do I secretly wish I had a different phone. The one issue that springs to mind though is the Bluetooth. It hangs if you try to pair another device whilst you already have one connected. It's best you disconnect the current device and then connect the latest one. It doesn't forget your previous devices it just doesn't like to have the new one join without the other one disconnected. I trust that makes sense! Welcome back Nokia.

I had come from a Samsung S10e and if any of you knew that phone, you would know it is a small and very compact phone. My battery life on the Samsung was really bad, so I had decided to get an iPhone 11. Happy to say that I don't regret buying it.I had got the initial phone for £480 ish as I brought the 128gb version, since I needed the storage. I have barely used half of the storage too, which is good. The battery is actually good, it goes down gradually as the hours pass, but sometimes I notice that if I keep certain apps like Spotify opened up for a long time, the battery tends to go down faster, but that's probably because I have Spotify on 24/7. However, on a normal day, the battery basically lasts for most of the day."

It has so many benefits it just can't go wrong, Once you start using iPhone you're stuck with them forever it has an amazing camera and night mode and a very good screen, you can find so many accessories everywhere. Overall I'm happy with the purchase. The only downside is probably the battery is not the best, but I'm probably being too demanding as I'm comparing it with my iphone 13 pro max."

      "introduction": "The iPhone 11 is a smartphone designed, developed, and marketed by Apple Inc. It is the thirteenth generation of iPhone, succeeding the iPhone XR, and was unveiled on September 10, 2019 alongside the iPhone 11 Pro at the Steve Jobs Theater in Apple Park, Cupertino, by Apple CEO Tim Cook. Preorders began on September 13, 2019, and the phone was officially released on September 20, 2019, one day after the official public release of iOS 13.Despite minimal exterior changes from the preceding iPhone XR, substantial design changes within the phone took place, including the addition of the more powerful Apple A13 Bionic chip as well as an ultra-wide dual-camera system.In October 2020, Apple halted the inclusion of both Apple EarPods and the wall adapter, citing environmental goals.As of March 2022, the iPhone 11 has sold 159.2 million units worldwide, making it the tenth best-selling smartphone of all time.The iPhone 11 as well as the iPhone 12 mini and iPhone 13 Pro with its Max variant were discontinued and removed from Apple's website after the announcement of the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro on September 7, 2022.",

The glaring fault is it keeps turning itself off and restarting about twice a day. I contacted Nokia about this and got the standard reply, start in safe mode blah blah blah. I purchased this phone to use not monkey about with do this do that and if that wont work do this and so it goes on. I am not tech-savvy and if i buy a tv or whatever i don't want to go poking around with it every day after setting it up to get it working. Nokia are so uninterested in this widespread problem they said i could always return it. Not the answer i wanted from them. They also state they have no idea when it will update to android 11 and condescendingly advise to check for updates regularly. So i say it's a nice phone if you want to look at it but no use as a reliable phone."

While I was aware of this, in use it seems as if the content doesn’t fit the screen properly (true of all iPhone since no one makes content for this messed up display shape). Full screen movies and videos lose a chunk of the image where the notch is, and though some video content could be scaled down, on apps like Netflix, a wide movie does not look great because some movies cannot be scaled down. What is the point of getting such an expensive phone which cuts off part of the picture? Even the apps look ill-fitted. I just can’t get used to it and Apple really need to get rid of the notch. It is very distracting and makes everything on screen look bad. Some people might get used to it or they might not find it bothersome but that doesn’t change the fact that it is there. It is a shame because the screen has an excellent resolution but I still find the rounded corners ruins video and gaming content because things aren’t designed to be displayed like that, and so much gets cut off."

I went to bed put my phone on the side and woke up to a non working phone. Took it to an Apple shop for them to inform me I got the “black screen of death” and quoted me £370 to get it fixed. Apparently it’s a fault in the mini phones everything becomes unresponsive and you get a black screen, it’s an absolute joke! The phone was only a year and 4 months old in brand new condition. I refuse to pay £370 for it to be fixed when I only paid £100 more to buy it brand new. Apple need to sort it out!!!!"

      "introduction": "In 1986, Paul Newman and his closest friend, screenwriter Stewart Stern, began an extraordinary project. Stuart was to compile an oral history, to have Newman’s family and friends and those who worked closely with him, talk about the actor’s life. And then Newman would work with Stewart and give his side of the story. The only stipulation was that anyone who spoke on the record had to be completely honest. That same stipulation applied to Newman himself. The project lasted five years.The result is an extraordinary memoir, culled from thousands of pages of transcripts. The book is insightful, revealing, surprising. Newman’s voice is powerful, sometimes funny, sometimes painful, always meeting that high standard of searing honesty. The additional voices—from childhood friends and Navy buddies, from family members and film and theater collaborators such as Tom Cruise, George Roy Hill, Martin Ritt, and John Huston—that run throughout add richness and color and context to the story Newman is telling.",

It talks about the peaceful deep satisfaction of humans living in symbiosis with the land and its plants and animals and how the maker seems to have designed nature so that its components complement and serve each other. The author, an indigenous member of the Potawatome group of native Americans, has a PhD in botany, an area she chose because of her love for plants. She tries to balance her knowledge of Science with the legends of the Potawatome. These legends support a view of life that consists of gratitude for the land and its fruits as well as respect for how and how much they are used. They are almost as romantic as they are fanciful. The Potawatome believe that all parts of nature are close to sentient beings. In fact, plants gift their fruits to humans. Even fish are seen to gift their lives for food to humans."

Wall Kimmerer takes us through experiences and knowledge she has gained in her life through her connection to both science and Indigenous Wisdom. Wall Kimmerer discusses the near annihilation of Indigenous people’s traditions, ideas, and languages. Not to mention their removal from their lands and their cultural assimilation into the new European-American culture. This was forced upon Indigenous people and there are still lasting effects to this day that they strive to counteract. Language is only carried on through elders that wish to pass on the language and culture to the youth. Robin Wall Kimmerer is a member of the Citizen Potawatomi Nation and had felt disconnected from her Native American roots because of the strong American identity that had been forced upon Native Americans when Europeans arrived. By dedicating much of her time to the study of plants and the connections she can find to Indigenous Wisdom she has been able to combine both perspectives as objectively as she can."

In reflections that range from the creation of Turtle Island to the forces that threaten its flourishing today, she circles toward a central argument: that the awakening of ecological consciousness requires the acknowledgment and celebration of our reciprocal relationship with the rest of the living world. For only when we can hear the languages of other beings will we be capable of understanding the generosity of the earth, and learn to give our own gifts in return.",

This book is a collection of blogs or short stories often breaking into stream of consciousness mode. Further, the title Inciting Joy made me expect a number of situations that invoke joy in the author if not typical human beings. Very few of the essays qualify in my view of Joy. For example, one essay describes not being able to locate the rental car return lot at an airport. Round and round he went, stopping a few times for directions to no avail. On and on he described being worried about making his flight. In most people such an experience would incite stress. His experience playing football involved physical pain. For years he vomited once a day. For another period of time, he understood he had a mental health problem and worried about killing his mother."

But if we want change, we hope we can change it overnight. But if it doesn’t change we are quick to give up and return right back to the older bad habits we learned.

James Clear, one of the world's leading experts on habit formation, reveals practical strategies that will teach you exactly how to form good habits, break bad ones, and master the tiny behaviors that lead to remarkable results.If you're having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn't you. The problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don't want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change. You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems. Here, you'll get a proven system that can take you to new heights.Clear is known for his ability to distill complex topics into simple behaviors that can be easily applied to daily life and work. Here, he draws on the most proven ideas from biology, psychology, and neuroscience to create an easy-to-understand guide for making good habits inevitable and bad habits impossible. Along the way, readers will be inspired and entertained with true stories from Olympic gold medalists, award-winning artists, business leaders, life-saving physicians, and star comedians who have used the science of small habits to master their craft and vault to the top of their field.",

I did not know what a “principal balance” was until a few weeks ago and I’m in my 30’s. My family lived pay check to pay check and if that’s your experience you have no money to figure out what to do with so how/why would you explain to your kids?! Also if you talk about this book about being victimizing or dramatic you definitely live in a privilege bubble and probably never or rarely spoken to people of color or those who suffer from food/financial insecurities. I tell all my friends and coworkers and even patients (mental health nurse) about the podcast and book because if you’ve spent anytime outside your comfort zone or with marginalized communities or lgbtq you know that it’s unfair and there’s a NEED for this education. I love it. I’m here for it. I will continue to share it. Thank you Tori."

I really used this book as a tool (which is why it took me so long to read) and did the exercises at the end of each chapter. I wrote down my goals in explicit detail and how I can get there, I analyzed a month’s worth of purchases, and really worked with this book to get the most I could out of it. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to learn about taking control of your finances and making sense of your money and spending/saving habits."

      "introduction": "Tori Dunlap was always good with money. As a kid, she watched her prudent parents balance their checkbook every month and learned to save for musical tickets by gathering pennies in an Altoids tin. But she quickly discovered that her experience with money was pretty unusual, especially among her female friends.It wasn’t our fault. Investigating this financial literacy and wealth gap, Tori found that girls are significantly less likely to receive a holistic financial education; we’re taught to restrain our spending, while boys are taught about investing and rewarded for pursuing wealth. In adulthood, women are hounded by the unfounded stereotype of the frivolous spenders whose lattes are to blame for the wealth gap. And when something like, say, a global pandemic happens, we’re the first to have jobs cut and the last to re-enter the workforce. It's no wonder money is a source of anxiety and a barrier to equality for so many of us.But what if money didn't mean restriction, and instead, choice? The ability to luxuriously travel, quit toxic jobs, donate to important organizations, retire early? The freedom to live the life you want, and change the world while you do it? Tori founded Her First $100K to teach women to overcome the unique obstacles standing in the way of their financial freedom. In Financial Feminist, she distills the principles of her shame- and judgment-free approach to paying off debt, figuring out your value categories to spend mindfully, saving money without monk-like deprivation, and investing in order to spend your retirement tanning in Tulum.",

      "introduction": "The lifeblood of any free society is persuasion: changing other people’s minds in order to change things. But America is suffering a crisis of faith in persuasion that is putting its democracy and the planet itself at risk. Americans increasingly write one another off instead of seeking to win one another over. Debates are framed in moralistic terms, with enemies battling the righteous. Movements for justice build barriers to entry, instead of on-ramps. Political parties focus on mobilizing the faithful rather than wooing the skeptical. And leaders who seek to forge coalitions are labeled sellouts.In The Persuaders, Anand Giridharadas takes us inside these movements and battles, seeking out the dissenters who continue to champion persuasion in an age of polarization. We meet a leader of Black Lives Matter; a trailblazer in the feminist resistance to Trumpism; white parents at a seminar on raising adopted children of color; Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez; a team of door knockers with an uncanny formula for changing minds on immigration; an ex-cult member turned QAnon deprogrammer; and, hovering menacingly offstage, Russian operatives clandestinely stoking Americans’ fatalism about one another.",

But the twin plagues of COVID-19 and anti-Black police violence inspired her to rethink the importance of small, individual actions. Part memoir, part manifesto, Viral Justice is a sweeping and deeply personal exploration of how we can transform society through the choices we make every day.Vividly recounting her personal experiences and those of her family, Benjamin shows how seemingly minor decisions and habits could spread virally and have exponentially positive effects. She recounts her father’s premature death, illuminating the devastating impact of the chronic stress of racism, but she also introduces us to community organizers who are fostering mutual aid and collective healing. Through her brother’s experience with the criminal justice system, we see the trauma caused by policing practices and mass imprisonment, but we also witness family members finding strength as they come together to demand justice for their loved ones. And while her own challenges as a young mother reveal the vast inequities of our healthcare system, Benjamin also describes how the support of doulas and midwives can keep Black mothers and babies alive and well.",

My grumble would be that the author is a reporter who has followed Trump for years, so she knows his life well. The uninitiated will be less well informed, so the lack of context might make people think “Wait, hold on a minute there…” in places if they’re less well versed in the minutiae of Trump’s life."

Trump's presidency like no other journalist, Confidence Man is a magnificent and disturbing reckoning that chronicles his life and its meaning from his rise in New York City to his tortured post-presidency.Few journalists working today have covered Donald Trump more extensively than Maggie Haberman. And few understand him and his motivations better. Now, demonstrating her majestic command of this story, Haberman reveals in full the depth of her understanding of the 45th president himself, and of what the Trump phenomenon means.Interviews with hundreds of sources and numerous interviews over the years with Trump himself portray a complicated and often contradictory historical figure. Capable of kindness but relying on casual cruelty as it suits his purposes. Pugnacious. Insecure. Lonely. Vindictive. Menacing. Smarter than his critics contend and colder and more calculating than his allies believe. A man who embedded himself in popular culture, galvanizing support for a run for high office that he began preliminary spadework for 30 years ago, to ultimately become a president who pushed American democracy to the brink.The through-line of Trump's life and his presidency is the enduring question of what is in it for him or what he needs to say to survive short increments of time in the pursuit of his own interests.",

It is written from the perspective of the man himself and what a tale to tell. Being born while still in the embryonic sac to navigating thru life with his wits and inner fire. As a resident of Virginia it was eye opening to learn of places in the far corner of the state that I did not know existed ( like the Devil’s Bathtub). His childhood with his best friend Maggot under the watchful eye of Mrs.Peggot is blissfully brought to life. He and his friend are allowed to run around and explore. They go fishing with Mr. Peggot and he teaches them how to shoot. This all comes to an end when Demon’s mom gets married to Stoner a man who wants his mother but not him. It goes downhill from there with his mom being unable to handle the pressure of the battle of wills between Stoner and Demon. She first OD’s and he is sent into foster care thru the county DSS, due to Demon having been abused by his stepfather Stoner."

What matters is that the plot races along and the voice of the main character manages to be individual and regional and yet easy to read -- no false dialect crap here. Kingsolver herself is one of those writers, like Philip Larkin or Robert Frost, who somehow can produce writing that sounds as natural as talking and yet that somehow comes out as poetry. Best new book from any writer that I've read in the past several years."

      "introduction": "Demon Copperhead is set in the mountains of southern Appalachia. It's the story of a boy born to a teenaged single mother in a single-wide trailer, with no assets beyond his dead father's good looks and copper-colored hair, a caustic wit, and a fierce talent for survival. In a plot that never pauses for breath, relayed in his own unsparing voice, he braves the modern perils of foster care, child labor, derelict schools, athletic success, addiction, disastrous loves, and crushing losses. Through all of it, he reckons with his own invisibility in a popular culture where even the superheroes have abandoned rural people in favor of cities.Many generations ago, Charles Dickens wrote David Copperfield from his experience as a survivor of institutional poverty and its damages to children in his society. Those problems have yet to be solved in ours. Dickens is not a prerequisite for readers of this novel, but he provided its inspiration. In transposing a Victorian epic novel to the contemporary American South, Barbara Kingsolver enlists Dickens' anger and compassion, and above all, his faith in the transformative powers of a good story. Demon Copperhead speaks for a new generation of lost boys, and all those born into beautiful, cursed places they can't imagine leaving behind.",

I don't know if it has elastin but it has a stretchy quality to it which is nice .. my old and new underarmour raid shirts are stretchy so I love that .. it runs a little small so if you wear large be sure you have no belly or lose some weight before wearing this shirt regularly or buy a size bigger .. but one thing I will say is I'm not sure if this is authentic nike or a knock off .. maybe someone else can chime in .. the swoosh is on your right side(when you are wearing it) and it's raised and looks like a fabric material .. my other nike shirts have a flat swoosh on the left side .. overall I like it so far so I'm gonna keep it and see how it holds up"

They've all lasted less than a few months due to the weight of all my gadgets plus the constant moving around I have to do for work. This backpack seems to be a cut above. Looks cool, robust zippers, charging port, water-resistant, and still looks rather new considering I've had it for several months and use the heck out of it with my busy work schedule. The padded shoulder straps and rear pads also make it really comfortable considering the amount of weight I have inside. Looks like its going to last longer than my previous bags, and am already considering purchasing another one. Great backpack!"

The compartments are more practical than those nets I found on the outside of backpacks. Since the back part is always fixed to allow air to circulate, I have not transported a laptop in my backpack so far."
